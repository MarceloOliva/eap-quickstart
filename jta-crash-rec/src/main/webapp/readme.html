<h1>Example of JTA Crash Recovery</h1>
<p>Author: Mike Musgrove</p>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>If your application needs to modify more than one resource, for example MDBs and databases, you need to use distributed transactions. We call these <em>XA transactions</em>
<a href="https://www2.opengroup.org/ogsys/jsp/publications/PublicationDetails.jsp?catalogno=c193">after the standard</a> in which they were first introduced.</p>
<p>An important feature of this quickstart is to demonstrate XA recovery by showing how the system is brought back into a consistent state after halting the application server. <em>"XA recovery deals with system or application failures to ensure that resources of a transaction are applied consistently to all resources affected by the transaction, even if any of the application processes or the machine hosting them crash or lose network connectivity."</em></p>
<p>This example shows how to atomically update a relational database table using JPA and send a message using JMS. These kinds of paired updates to two different resources are called XA transactions and are defined by the JEE JTA specification. In this example, we use H2 (<a href="http://www.h2database.com">http://www.h2database.com</a>) for the database. Although H2 XA support is not recommended for production systems, the example does illustrate the general steps you need to perform for any datasource vendor.</p>
<p>The relational table contains two columns to represent a key value pair - the application presents an HTML form containing two input boxes for creating, updating, deleting or listing these pairs. When you add or update a key value pair the quickstart starts a transaction, updates the table, produces a JMS message containing the update and finally commits the transaction. If all goes well, eventually the consumer gets the message and generates a database update setting the value corresponding to the key to something that indicates it was changed by the message consumer.</p>
<p>The idea is to demonstrate recovery by halting the application server after the database modification is committed but before the JMS producer is committed.</p>
<h2>System requirements</h2>
<p>You will need Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) and Maven 3.0 or better.</p>
<p>The application this project produces is designed to be run on a JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7.</p>
<p>The example uses Byteman which is a java agent and a set of tools that enables the user
to insert extra Java code into an application. Byteman can be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.jboss.org/byteman/downloads/">http://www.jboss.org/byteman/downloads/</a>. Once downloaded, extract Byteman to a location
on your hard drive.</p>
<p>In order to keep the instructions manageable the various OS commands target linux based systems
but with minor changes to file paths and executable names will work on Windows systems too.</p>
<h2>Database Configuration</h2>
<p>This example provides its own H2 XA datasource configuration. It is define in the "H2XADS1-ds.xml" file in the WEB-INF folder of the war archive. In JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6, deploying via war archives is not a supported feature so additional instructions are provided for deploying via the console. You might also need the instructions if you want to run with a different database.</p>
<p>The <a href="#xaconfig">Configure an XA datasource</a> instructions below outline how to create an H2 XA datasource using JBoss AS 7 administration tools. If you do decide to experiment with other databases, we recommend you use a more robust XA database such as PostgreSQL. Instructions for installing and setting up PostgreSQL can be found in the README at the root of the quickstart directory.</p>
<h2>Build and Deploy the application</h2>
<p>The example requires more configuration steps than most apps. In brief:</p>
<a id="clear-transaction-objectstore"/>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Make sure there is no transaction objectstore data left after testing any of the other quickstarts.
If you are using the default file based transaction logging store then:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open a command line and type the following:</p>
<pre><code>ls JBOSS_HOME/standalone/data/tx-object-store/ShadowNoFileLockStore/defaultStore/StateManager/BasicAction/TwoPhaseCoordinator/AtomicAction/
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this directory exists and contains any files, delete them before starting the server:</p>
<pre><code>rm -rf JBOSS_HOME/standalone/data/tx-object-store/ShadowNoFileLockStore/defaultStore/StateManager/BasicAction/TwoPhaseCoordinator/AtomicAction/*
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>On windows use the file manager to accomplish the same result.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This example requires a JMS queue destination called <em>testQueue</em>. If your configuration does not contain the JMS testQueue, you must modify the standalone-full.xml file as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml file</li>
<li>Find <code>&lt;subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:messaging:1.1"&gt;</code> in the file</li>
<li>Look for <code>&lt;jms-destinations&gt;</code> in this section. If you see a jms-queue name="testQueue", you do not need to make any changes. You can move on to the next step. </li>
<li>
<p>If there is a <code>&lt;jms-destinations&gt;</code> section under this subsystem, copy the following XML prior to <code>&lt;/jms-destinations&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;jms-queue name="testQueue"&gt;
            &lt;entry name="queue/test"/&gt;
            &lt;entry name="java:jboss/exported/jms/queue/test"/&gt;
    &lt;/jms-queue&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is not a <code>&lt;jms-destinations&gt;</code>, copy the following right before the <code>&lt;/hornetq-server&gt;</code> end tag:</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;jms-destinations&gt;
        &lt;jms-queue name="testQueue"&gt;
            &lt;entry name="queue/test"/&gt;
            &lt;entry name="java:jboss/exported/jms/queue/test"/&gt;
        &lt;/jms-queue&gt;
    &lt;/jms-destinations&gt;
</code></pre>
<a id="start-server">

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7 with the full profile using the following command: </p>
<pre><code>        JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build and deploy the quickstart archive</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to the root of this quickstart directory</li>
<li>
<p>Type the following to build the archive:</p>
<p><code>mvn clean package</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deploy the archive to the running JBoss server by typing the following:</p>
<p><code>mvn jboss-as:deploy</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application is available at the URL <a href="http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-jta-crash-rec/XA">http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-jta-crash-rec/XA</a>. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Test the application</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When you access the application, you will find a web page containing two html input boxes for adding key value pairs to a database. Instructions on using the application are shown at the top of the application web page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you add a new key value pair, the change is committed to the database and a JMS message sent. The message consumer then updates the row just inserted by appending the text <em>"updated via JMS"</em> to the value.
Since the consumer updates the row asynchronously you may need to list the key value pair just entered to
see the extra text in the value part of the pair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When an <em>XA transaction</em> is committed, the application server does the completion in two phases.</p>
<ul>
<li>In phase 1 each resource, in this example a database and a JMS message producer, is asked to prepare to commit any changes made during the transaction. </li>
<li>If all resources vote to commit then the application server starts phase 2 in which it tells each resource to commit those changes. </li>
<li>The added complexity is to cope with failures, especially failures that occur during phase 2. Some failure modes require cooperation between the application server and the resources in order to guarantee that any pending changes are recovered. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>To demonstrate XA recovery, you need to enable the Byteman tool to terminate the application server while <em>phase 2</em> is running as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a key/value pair as instructed in the application.</li>
<li>Stop the application server.</li>
<li>Make sure there is no <a href="#clear-transaction-objectstore">transaction objectstore data</a> remaining from previous tests.</li>
<li><a href="#byteman">Enable Byteman by following the instructions below</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#start-server">Start the application server</a> as instructed above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have completed step 4 then you are ready to create a <em>recovery record</em>. Go to the application URL <a href="http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-jta-crash-rec/XA">http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-jta-crash-rec/XA</a> and insert another row into the database. At this point, Byteman halts the application server. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to verify the database insert was committed but that message delivery is still pending, use an SQL client such as the H2 database console tool to show that the value is present but does not contain the message added by the consumer (<em>" updated via JMS"</em>). Here is how you can do it using H2:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Start the H2 console by typing:</p>
<pre><code>java -jar &lt;AS install directory&gt;/modules/com/h2database/h2/main/h2*.jar
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The console is available at the url <a href="http://localhost:8082">http://localhost:8082</a>. If you receive an error such as <code>Exception opening port "8082"</code> it is most likely because some other application has that port open. You will need to find which application is using the port and close it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter the following information in the console. These values correspond to the values in the datasource configuration of the standalone-full.xml file:</p>
<pre><code>Database URL:  `jdbc:h2:file:~/xaqs1`
User name:      sa
Password:       sa
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you are logged in enter the following query to see that the pair you entered is present but does not contain <em>"updated via JMS"</em>.</p>
<pre><code>select * from xa_kvpair
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>H2 only allows one connection per database, so make sure you close the H2 console before restarting the Application Server.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are using the default file based transaction logging store, there will be a record in the file system corresponding to the pending transaction. </p>
<ul>
<li>Open a command line and navigate to the JBOSS_HOME/bin directory</li>
<li>
<p>List the contents of the following directory:</p>
<pre><code> ls ../standalone/data/tx-object-store/ShadowNoFileLockStore/defaultStore/StateManager/BasicAction/TwoPhaseCoordinator/AtomicAction/
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>An example of a logging record file name is: </p>
<pre><code> `0_ffff7f000001_-7f1cf331_4f0b0ad4_15`.
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>After recovery, log records are normally deleted automatically, except in the case where the Transaction Manager (TM) commit request was received and acted upon by a resource but the TM crashed before it had time to clean up the logs of that resource.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>To observe XA recovery</p>
<ul>
<li>First, <a href="#byteman">disable the Byteman script</a> </li>
<li>Be sure the H2 console is closed.</li>
<li><a href="#start-server">Restart the application server</a> as instructed above. </li>
<li>By the time the application server is ready, the transaction should have recovered.</li>
<li>A message is printed on the application console when the consumer has completed the update. Look for a line that reads 'JTA Crash Record Quickstart: key value pair updated via JMS'.</li>
<li>Check that the row you inserted in step 4 now contains the text <em>"updated via JMS"</em>, showing that the JMS message was recovered successfully. Use the application URL to perform this check.</li>
<li>
<p>You will most likely see the following message on the console. </p>
<pre><code>`ARJUNA016038: No XAResource to recover ... eis_name=...H2XADS1` during recovery.
</code></pre>
<p>This is normal. What actually happened is that the first resource (H2XADS1) committed before the AS was halted in step 5. The transaction logs are only updated/deleted after the outcome of the transaction is determined. If the transaction manager did update the log as each participant (database and JMS queue) completed then throughput would suffer. Notice you do not get a similar message for the JMS resource since that is the resource that recovered and the log record was updated to reflect this change. You need to manually remove the record for the first participant if you know which one is which or, if you are using the community version of the AS then you can also inspect the transaction logs using a JMX browser. For the demo it is simplest to delete the records from the file system (but <em>be wary of doing this on a production system</em>). If you need to clear out the H2 database then delete its backing files (<code>rm ~/xaqs1*</code>). In a future version of the transactions module clean up should be automatic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Downloading the sources and Javadocs</h2>
<p>If you want to be able to debug into the source code or look at the Javadocs
of any library in the project, you can run either of the following two
commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect
them.</p>
<pre><code>    mvn dependency:sources
    mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc
</code></pre>
<h2><a name="xaconfig"/> Optional Step: Configure an XA datasource</h2>
<p>Step 1. Create an admin user with access to the ManagementRealm. This gives you access to the
        AS7 web admin console):</p>
<pre><code>    [mmusgrov@dev1 bin]$ ./add-user.sh

    Enter the details of the new user to add.
    Realm (ManagementRealm) : 
    Username : admin
    Password : 
    Re-enter Password : 
    The username 'admin' is easy to guess
    Are you sure you want to add user 'admin' yes/no? yes
    About to add user 'admin' for realm 'ManagementRealm'
    Is this correct yes/no? yes
    Added user 'admin' to file '.../jboss-as/build/target/jboss-as-7.1.0.Final-SNAPSHOT/standalone/configuration/mgmt-users.properties'
    Added user 'admin' to file '.../jboss-as/build/target/jboss-as-7.1.0.Final-SNAPSHOT/domain/configuration/mgmt-users.properties'
</code></pre>
<p>Step 2. Create a Datasource</p>
<pre><code>    Go to the JBoss web console url:
    &lt;http://localhost:9990/console/&gt; and login as the admin user you just created.

    Select the Profile tab (top right) and from the menu on the left choose Connector -&gt; Datasources.

    Choose the XA Datasources tab. Click the Add button (top right) to create an XA Datasource:

        Step 1/4:
        Name: java:jboss/datasources/H2XADS1
        JNDI Name: java:jboss/datasources/H2XADS1

        Step 2/4: Select the default XA Driver (ie Name: h2 and Datasource Class: org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource)

        Step 3/4: Add an single property to define the backing file for the database
        Key: URL and Value: jdbc:h2:file:*/xaqs1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE

        Step 4/4: Define Connection Settings (Username: sa and Password: sa)

    Select the new XA Datasource and click the Attributes tab. Click the Enable button.
</code></pre>
<p>Step 3. There is one final attribute that needs setting which can only be done via the command shell.
        For each datasource you need to set the recovery credentials as follows:</p>
<pre><code>    Go to the AS bin directory and start the command shell:

        &gt; [mmusgrov@dev1 bin]$ ./jboss-cli.sh --connect
        [standalone@localhost:9999 /] cd /subsystem=datasources/xa-data-source="java:jboss/datasources/H2XADS1"
        [standalone@localhost:9999 xa-data-source=java:jboss/datasources/H2XADS1] :write-attribute(name="recovery-username",value="sa")
        {
            "outcome" =&gt; "success",
                "response-headers" =&gt; {
                "operation-requires-reload" =&gt; true,
                "process-state" =&gt; "reload-required"
            }
        }
        [standalone@localhost:9999 xa-data-source=java:jboss/datasources/H2XADS1] :write-attribute(name="recovery-password",value="sa")
        {
            "outcome" =&gt; "success",
                "response-headers" =&gt; {
                "operation-requires-reload" =&gt; true,
                "process-state" =&gt; "reload-required"
            }
        }

    Now go back to the web console Runtime tab and select Server -&gt; Configuration
    (from the left menu) and click the Reload button on the far left.
</code></pre>
<p>At the end of this process you should end up with an entry similar to the following in your
standalone-full.xml config file:</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;xa-datasource jndi-name="java:jboss/datasources/H2XADS1" pool-name="java:jboss/datasources/H2XADS1" enabled="true" use-ccm="false"&gt;
                &lt;xa-datasource-property name="URL"&gt;
                    jdbc:h2:file:/tmp/xaqs1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE
                &lt;/xa-datasource-property&gt;
                &lt;driver&gt; h2 &lt;/driver&gt;
                &lt;xa-pool&gt;
                    &lt;is-same-rm-override&gt; false &lt;/is-same-rm-override&gt;
                    &lt;interleaving&gt; false &lt;/interleaving&gt;
                    &lt;pad-xid&gt; false &lt;/pad-xid&gt;
                    &lt;wrap-xa-resource&gt; true &lt;/wrap-xa-resource&gt;
                &lt;/xa-pool&gt;
                &lt;security&gt;
                    &lt;user-name&gt; sa &lt;/user-name&gt;
                    &lt;password&gt; sa &lt;/password&gt;
                &lt;/security&gt;
                &lt;recovery&gt;
                    &lt;recover-credential&gt;
                        &lt;user-name&gt; sa &lt;/user-name&gt;
                        &lt;password&gt; sa &lt;/password&gt;
                    &lt;/recover-credential&gt;
                &lt;/recovery&gt;
                &lt;validation&gt;
                    &lt;validate-on-match&gt; false &lt;/validate-on-match&gt;
                    &lt;background-validation&gt; false &lt;/background-validation&gt;
                    &lt;background-validation-millis&gt; 0 &lt;/background-validation-millis&gt;
                &lt;/validation&gt;
                &lt;statement&gt;
                    &lt;prepared-statement-cache-size&gt; 0 &lt;/prepared-statement-cache-size&gt;
                    &lt;share-prepared-statements&gt; false &lt;/share-prepared-statements&gt;
                &lt;/statement&gt;
            &lt;/xa-datasource&gt;
</code></pre>

Halting the Application using Byteman</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: After you have finished with the quickstart, it is important to restore your backup of standalone.conf thereby removing the Byteman configuration from the standalone.conf[.bat] file. Otherwise your server will always crash when a transaction commits!*</p>
<p>[The Byteman downloads also contains scripts for installing the Bytman agent ('bminstall.sh <procid>' and 'bminstall.bat <procid>') and for uploading Byteman scripts ('bmsubmit.sh -l src/main/scripts/xa.btm' and 'bmsubmit.bat -l src/main/scripts/xa.btm'). The bat scripts are only available in later releases of Byteman. Personally I prefer these scripts since they give me more control over loading and unloading rules and I don't need to worry about forgetting to put
standalone.conf back to its original contents.]</p>
